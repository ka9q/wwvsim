# WWV
WWV/WWVH emulator. Full format including 100 Hz timecode. Speech by local OS's synthesizer; OSX is best

This started as a quick hack but ended up fully functional. Without
redirection, the program writes directly to the system sound device
synchronized to the local system clock, which in turn should track an
external reference with the Network Time Protocol, NTP, or a local GPS
receiver.

When redirected, wwvsim generates raw 16-bit linear PCM mono audio at
a 48 kHz sample rate on standard output.

The WWV program is generated by default. With the -H option, the WWVH
program is generated.  Run wwvsim with a bogus argument, e.g., 'wwvsim
-?' to get a complete list of command line arguments.

The program relies on the speech synthesizer bundled with the local
system for time announcements. This seems to work best on Mac OSX,
which has the 'say' program. On Linux, the 'espeak' program is used,
but it sounds much worse.  Hopefully there are some better open source
speech synthesizers out there.

The half-hour station IDs now use the original WWV/WWVH audio recordings.

This program is really a novelty; don't use it for anything really
precise. That's what the original WWV and WWVH are for!
